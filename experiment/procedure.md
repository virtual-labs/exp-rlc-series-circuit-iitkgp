## Procedure

- Connect the circuit elements as mentioned below 1-3 ,4-5 ,8-6, 6-10, 9-11, 2-7, 7-9(ex:-Drag from 1 and click on 3.)
- 3 volt p-p sinusoidal voltage is applied at the input.Put R=200Ω initially ,L=0.1H, C=0.1uF.
- Switch on the oscilloscope by clicking "ON" button & click twice the Sine wave button for input signal & click on the"Output" button to observe the output.Channel & Channel2 button shows the input & output signals respectively. Dual, shows both of them.
- Change the Frequency of input signal by the Frequency knob from 100Hz to 5KHz or 5000Hz & observe the corresponding output voltage signal.
- If in any case the output signal waveform exceeds the graphical grid or the oscilloscope area,increase the value of volt/div through volt/div knob both for input and output signals. for Ex. for 1500Hz it may be observed. Then increase the volt/div values to approximate 2 using those two volt/div knobs. Again if in any case the input signal comes as a straight line, decrease the Time/div value to 0.2 using Time/div knob at the bottom.
- Switch off the oscilloscope
- Click on Tableshow button each time after clicking on "output" button to see observation each time.
- Click on 'GainPlot' button to see the frequency response plot(Gain(dB)vs.Frequency(Hz))& click on the 'Phaseplot'button to see the corresponding phase response.Click on Clear button to clear datas.
- Switch off the oscilloscope.Change 'R' value by increasing the rheostat to increase the value of ζ and observe different results for ζ = (0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,0.7).
- From the Gain plots the maximum gain,-3dB frequency can be observed for different ζ .
