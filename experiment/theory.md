# Introduction

Series RLC circuits consist of a resistance, a capacitance and an inductance connected in series across an alternating supply. Series RLC circuits are classed as second-order circuits because they contain two energy storage elements, an inductance L and a capacitance C. Consider the RLC circuit below. In this experiment a circuit(Fig 1) will be provided. A p-p sinusoidal signal of amplitude 3V will be applied to it and its frequency response would be verified .

The gain and phase response against frequency will be typical of second order system. The expected maximum gain for each ζ can be observed from the plot in the experiment. Theoretical expression for obtaining maximum gain is,
